                Rubina planned our Kashmir trip very well. She and her team were
                at disposal whenever we needed anything, really appreciate their
                responsiveness. All you have to do is enjoy your trip and worry
                nothing about logistics, accommodation, transportation etc.
                Thank you for organizing it so well!!

                It was a wonderful experience. The hotels provided were great.
                Whenever we had the smallest of problems we would call Rubina ji
                and she would take care of that. Thank you for giving us an
                experience to cherish. I would recommend everyone that if you
                ever plan to visit Kashmir or Ladakh give her a call and just
                enjoy to your fullest.

                I have booked a 5N6D trip to kashmir for my friends honeymoon as
                a gift to them. Rubina mam coordinated politely at every bit of
                the trip and fulfilled all the promises as done beforehand
                regarding accomodations , meals and travels. It was worth every
                penny and the services are just what were promised . Best in the
                game so far ...no hidden promises .....no hassles for the
                tourists ..totally recommend.

                Had a wonderful time in Kashmir. Thanks to Miss Rubina for
                organising the trip. It was an unforgettable experience. Don't
                miss out on the heavenly and adventurous outing you'll ever
                have.Comfy hotels, lip smacking food, mountains decked with
                snow, long drives amidst alluring valleys and streams. This is a
                place where one has to see before they die. And trust me you'll
                enjoy more than you thought you would. Kashmir Vendor was always
                there to guide us right from the beginning to the very end of
                the trip before you bid aidue to the Spectacular Kashmir. Indeed
                It's Heaven on Earth!! Ta-Ta.

                We planned our anniversary with them. We were picked by our
                driver (Feroz) from the airport. He was very understanding and
                cooperative. First day we spent at Khilona house boat which was
                neat,clean and proper hygiene measures were followed. Food was
                amazing. After which we watched tbe scenic beauty at Phalgam
                followed by our night at Eden hotel. This was all planned by
                Rubina. She is way too sweet and understood our requirement
                immediately and booked the best properties for us. Thanks to the
                team for such a wonderful trip. Also we will strongly recommend
                this to everybody. Thank to Mujjafar for the corporation too.
                You guys are doing well!

                Kashmir Vendor - Rubina had planned my trip to Kashmir 5N6D. She
                is having good experience in selecting the day wise itenary
                based on the weather and current trends & situation @ Kashmir.
                She has a tie up with good Tourist drivers or guide who help
                throughout the trip. She is very honest and genuine. If you are
                located anywhere from India can book a tour with her company..
