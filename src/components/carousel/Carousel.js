              Rubina planned our Kashmir trip very well. She and her team were
              at disposal whenever we needed anything, really appreciate their
              responsiveness. All you have to do is enjoy your trip and worry
              nothing about logistics, accommodation, transportation etc. Thank
              you for organizing it so well!!

              It was a wonderful experience. The hotels provided were great.
              Whenever we had the smallest of problems we would call Rubina ji
              and she would take care of that. Thank you for giving us an
              experience to cherish. I would recommend everyone that if you ever
              plan to visit Kashmir or Ladakh give her a call and just enjoy to
              your fullest.

              I have booked a 5N6D trip to kashmir for my friends honeymoon as a
              gift to them. Rubina mam coordinated politely at every bit of the
              trip and fulfilled all the promises as done beforehand regarding
              accomodations , meals and travels. It was worth every penny and
              the services are just what were promised . Best in the game so far
              ...no hidden promises .....no hassles for the tourists ..totally
              recommend.

              Had a wonderful time in Kashmir. Thanks to Miss Rubina for
              organising the trip. It was an unforgettable experience. Don't
              miss out on the heavenly and adventurous outing you'll ever
              have.Comfy hotels, lip smacking food, mountains decked with snow,
              long drives amidst alluring valleys and streams. This is a place
              where one has to see before they die. And trust me you'll enjoy
              more than you thought you would. Kashmir Vendor was always there
              to guide us right from the beginning to the very end of the trip
              before you bid aidue to the Spectacular Kashmir. Indeed It's
              Heaven on Earth!! Ta-Ta.
